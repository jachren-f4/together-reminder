# TogetherRemind 💕

**Privacy-first couples app for quick, caring reminders — no email, no calendar, no accounts.**

Send instant reminders and pokes to your partner's phone. Built with Flutter, Firebase, and local-first storage.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Run app (mock data auto-enabled on simulators)
flutter run -d <device-id>

# 3. For real device pairing, see Setup documentation
```

**Development Mode:** Mock data automatically injects on simulators for rapid testing.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Flutter 3.16+, Dart 3.2+, Material Design 3 |
| **Storage** | Hive (local NoSQL, type-safe) |

| **Notifications** | Firebase Cloud Messaging + APNs |
| **Backend** | Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js 20) |
| **Animations** | Lottie v3.1.3 |
| **Auth** | None (device pairing only) |

**Architecture:** Local-first, privacy-focused, offline-capable. RTDB used only for temporary pairing codes (10-min TTL).

## Technical Architecture

### Quest Title Synchronization

Quest metadata (titles, format types) is denormalized into the `DailyQuest` model to ensure cross-device consistency. The `quizName` field syncs via Firebase RTDB, eliminating session lookup dependencies that fail on devices that didn't create the content.

**Why this matters:** When Alice creates daily quests, Bob loads them from Firebase. Bob doesn't have quiz sessions in local storage (Alice does), so UI components must use quest metadata directly instead of session lookups.

See [docs/QUEST_TITLE_SYNC_ISSUE.md](./docs/QUEST_TITLE_SYNC_ISSUE.md) for detailed technical analysis.

## Privacy & Security

- 🔒 All reminder data stored **locally** on device
- 🔒 No cloud database or server-side storage
- 🔒 Push tokens transmitted via encrypted QR + FCM
- 🔒 Pairing codes expire after 10 minutes (1B+ combinations)
- 🔒 Hive supports optional AES encryption
- 🔒 No analytics or tracking (MVP)

**Bundle ID:** `com.togetherremind.togetherremind2` (changed after security remediation)

**User Controls:** Export data, clear history, unpair partner

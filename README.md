# TogetherRemind: Firebase → PostgreSQL Migration Project

🚀 **Production-ready migration plan with LOW risk profile**  
📅 **14-week timeline with comprehensive buffers**  
✅ **All critical issues resolved via Codex review validation**

---

## Project Overview

This project migrates TogetherRemind from Firebase Realtime Database to a Next.js + PostgreSQL architecture using Vercel and Supabase. The migration eliminates sync bugs, improves security, and provides better scalability.

### 🎯 Migration Goals

- ✅ **Eliminate all documented sync issues** (11-attempt debugging sessions gone)
- ✅ **Implement proper authentication** (Supabase Auth + JWT validation)  
- ✅ **Reduce infrastructure costs** (predictable free-tier hosting)
- ✅ **Improve security model** (Row Level Security vs weak RTDB rules)
- ✅ **Enable SQL flexibility** (relational queries vs denormalized JSON)

### 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Reduction |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| API Requests/day | 57.6M | 35.0M | **-39%** |
| Battery Drain | Baseline | -35% | **35% less** |
| Data Usage | 115GB/month | 70GB/month | **-39%** |
| Authentication Latency | 200ms+ | <1ms | **99% faster** |
| Connection Utilization | Unknown | <60 total | **Guaranteed** |
| Project Risk | HIGH | **LOW** | **75% reduction** |

## Quick Start: GitHub Issues Setup

### Step 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Make setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup_github_project.sh

# Run the setup script (creates labels, Phase 1 issues, milestones)
./scripts/setup_github_project.sh
```

### Step 2: Create Project Board
1. Go to repository → **Projects** → **New project**
2. Create board with configuration from `docs/GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP.md`
3. Add created issues to appropriate columns
4. Set up team views and filters

### Step 3: Generate Additional Phases
```bash
# Generate Phase 2: Dual-Write Validation (Weeks 4-5)
python scripts/generate_phase_issues.py --phase 2

# Generate Phase 3: Authentication Migration (Weeks 6-7)  
python scripts/generate_phase_issues.py --phase 3

# Generate Phase 4: Authentication Rollout (Weeks 6-7)
python scripts/generate_phase_issues.py --phase 4

# Add --dry-run to preview without creating
python scripts/generate_phase_issues.py --phase 2 --dry-run
```

### Step 4: Team Assignment
```bash
# Update team member references in generated issues
# Replace @backend-lead, @frontend-lead, @devops-lead, @qa-lead, @pm-lead
# with actual GitHub usernames of team members
```

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Contingency Plans

**If Authentication Fails:**
- Rollback to anonymous access
- Delay feature migration by 2 weeks
- Re-evaluate authentication strategy

**If Database Scaling Issues:**
- Implement read replicas
- Add Redis caching layer
- Consider alternative hosting options

**If Timeline Slips:**
- Re-prioritize feature migration order
- Add additional buffer weeks
- Consider phased cutover approach

### Rollback Triggers
- **Critical:** Authentication error rate >2% (1 hour)
- **Critical:** Database connection usage >90% (30 min)
- **Warning:** User complaints >10 per day
- **Warning:** API latency >500ms (1 hour)

Understanding your partner's dreams helps you support them and find places where your visions overlap.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different dream types reveal different values—the traveler seeks experience; the builder seeks legacy; the lifestyle-changer seeks transformation; the adventurer seeks intensity. Both dreams matter. Look for ways to honor both: travel to meaningful places, build adventures.",

The settler values rootedness and comfort; the adventurer values novelty and growth; the evolver values transformation; the community-builder values connection. These aren't right or wrong—they're different images of a good life. When partners' visions align, building the future feels collaborative. When they diverge, explicit conversation is needed.",

Water-seekers may need calm; city-lovers need stimulation; nature-seekers need peace; culture-seekers need novelty.

Naming the conversation you want opens the door to having it.",

          "rationale": "Attraction in long-term relationships evolves beyond physical appearance to encompass character traits, behaviors, and emotional presence. Gottman's research shows that couples who maintain awareness of what draws them to their partner—and express it—build what he calls 'fondness and admiration systems.' This question practices the skill of identifying and naming specific sources of attraction, which strengthens the positive sentiment override that protects relationships during conflict.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different answers aren't a mismatch—they reveal the multi-dimensional nature of attraction. Your partner is drawn to qualities you might take for granted in yourself. This is valuable information: you're each seeing real, attractive qualities the other may not fully recognize.",
          "whenSame": "When both partners identify the same quality, it often represents a cornerstone of your connection. This shared recognition suggests you've built part of your relationship identity around this trait. Consider how you can continue nurturing it.",
          "journalPrompt": "Think back to when you first noticed this quality in your partner. What moment made it stand out? How has your appreciation of it deepened or changed over time?"

          "rationale": "Admiration for how your partner navigates life's challenges is a powerful predictor of relationship longevity. When we respect our partner's character—not just enjoy their company—we build a foundation that withstands difficult seasons. This question taps into what researchers call 'perceived partner responsiveness': the belief that your partner is capable and competent. Couples who hold their partners in high esteem are more likely to turn toward each other during stress rather than away.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "You're each noticing different strengths in how your partner faces life. This is a gift—you're holding up a mirror to qualities they may not see clearly in themselves. These different observations often reflect what each of you values most or perhaps struggles with personally.",
          "whenSame": "Shared admiration for the same quality suggests this is a defining characteristic of your partner that shapes how you both experience the relationship. This trait likely provides stability or energy that you've come to rely on together.",

          "rationale": "Being impressed by your partner reflects what psychologists call 'positive illusions'—the tendency in healthy relationships to see your partner slightly more favorably than objective reality. Rather than being naive, this bias actively protects relationships. Partners who continue to be impressed by each other maintain curiosity and avoid the contempt that erodes connection. This question invites you to articulate specific competencies you admire, reinforcing the neural pathways associated with appreciation.",
          "framework": "positive_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "Different answers reveal the breadth of your partner's capabilities—you're each witnessing them excel in different arenas. This diversity of admiration means your partner receives validation across multiple dimensions of who they are, not just one narrow role.",
          "whenSame": "When both of you identify the same impressive quality, it's likely central to your partner's identity and possibly how they contribute to the relationship. This shared recognition can become a source of pride and confidence for them.",

Couples who maintain rich love maps continue to find delight in each other even after years together. The ability to smile at your partner's quirks—rather than be irritated by them—reflects a positive sentiment override that buffers the relationship against negativity. These micro-moments of fondness accumulate into deep, lasting affection.",

Couples who speak positively about each other to friends and family reinforce their own positive perceptions and create social accountability for treating each other well. This question surfaces what you consider your partner's 'headline quality'—the trait that most defines them in your eyes. Sharing this with your partner can be profoundly affirming, as it shows them how they exist in your mind when they're not present.",

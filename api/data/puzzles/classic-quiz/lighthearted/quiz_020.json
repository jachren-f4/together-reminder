Gottman's research shows that how couples tell their origin story predicts relationship success—couples who recall the beginning fondly, even after many years, maintain stronger bonds. This question practices the skill of returning to that initial spark.",

Couples who can articulate specific moments of realization tend to maintain stronger emotional connections.",

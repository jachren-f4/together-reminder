          "rationale": "How we want to be cared for when sick reveals attachment patterns and self-sufficiency needs. Some people regress and want to be fully taken care of; others want company and nurturing; some need space to recover independently; others need distraction from discomfort. Understanding your partner's sick-day needs prevents the well-meaning caretaker from smothering the independence-seeker, or leaving the nurturance-needer feeling abandoned.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "The caretaker may hover over a partner who wants space; the space-giver may seem cold to a partner who wants pampering. Ask directly when sick: 'What would help most right now?' Accept the answer even if it's different from what you'd want.",
          "whenSame": "Matched sick-care preferences mean you'll naturally give what the other needs. You'll intuit whether to stay close or give space. This reduces stress during already-uncomfortable times.",

          "rationale": "Embarrassment triggers shame, and how we want partners to respond in those moments is deeply personal. Some people defuse shame through humor; others need the moment to be ignored; others need active rescue; others need later reassurance. The wrong response can deepen embarrassment rather than ease it. Knowing your partner's embarrassment-response preference lets you be helpful rather than accidentally making things worse.",
          "framework": "shame_resilience",
          "whenDifferent": "The laugh-it-off person may crack a joke that lands wrong with a partner who wanted the moment ignored; the rescuer may draw more attention to a situation a partner wanted glossed over. Pre-discuss: 'If I'm ever embarrassed in public, what helps you most?'",

Listeners help us feel less alone; fixers help us move forward; reframers help us gain perspective; space-givers respect our need to process independently. A well-intentioned partner can accidentally worsen shame by offering the wrong kind of support. Understanding this is crucial for repair after mistakes.",

          "whenDifferent": "The listener may frustrate a partner who wants solutions; the fixer may overwhelm a partner who just needs to vent. After a mistake, ask: 'Do you want me to just listen, help problem-solve, give perspective, or give you space?' Then honor the answer.",

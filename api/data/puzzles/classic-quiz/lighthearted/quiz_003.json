Research shows that relationship satisfaction depends less on grand gestures and more on the quality of everyday interactions. Knowing which ordinary moments your partner cherishes helps you show up fully in those times rather than sleepwalking through them.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different favorite moments mean you each have different opportunities for connection. The morning person may be at their best over coffee; the evening person may be most present winding down. Honor each other's peak moments by being fully there when it matters to them.",

          "rationale": "How we unwind reflects what our nervous system needs to regulate. Some people need passive rest; others need active discharge; some need creative expression; some need nature's restorative environment; some need true stillness. Partners often judge each other's unwinding choices without understanding they serve different needs. What looks like 'wasting time' to one person is genuine recovery to another.",
          "framework": "stress_regulation",
          "whenDifferent": "The active unwinder may judge screen time as lazy; the passive unwinder may feel exhausted watching their partner go for a run. Let each other recover in your own ways. Don't impose your regulation needs on your partner.",
          "whenSame": "Matched unwinding preferences mean you can recharge together. If you both unwind through TV, watch together. If you both need activity, be active together. Shared recovery rituals strengthen connection.",

          "rationale": "Fatigue reveals our core attachment and recharge patterns. Some people need solitude when depleted; others draw energy from togetherness; some want presence without demands; some find connection through gentle words; some need silence. Partners who misunderstand each other's tired-state needs may feel rejected ('you don't want to be with me') or smothered ('just give me space').",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "The solitude-seeker may feel their partner is clingy when tired; the together-seeker may feel abandoned. State your needs explicitly when tired: 'I need alone time—it's not about you.' Agree on how you'll reconnect after recovery.",
          "whenSame": "Matched tired-state preferences mean evenings flow naturally. You'll both want the same thing at the end of a long day. Lean into this alignment—build rituals around your shared recovery style.",

          "rationale": "Weekend expectations often become a battleground for planning versus spontaneity preferences. The planner may see unstructured weekends as wasted; the spontaneous partner may feel scheduled weekends are work, not rest. Since weekends are precious recovery time, alignment here significantly affects relationship satisfaction and individual wellbeing.",

          "whenDifferent": "The planner may feel frustrated by their partner's refusal to commit to activities; the spontaneous partner may feel every weekend is a to-do list. Try: one planned activity per weekend day, with the rest unstructured. Or: alternate who plans each weekend.",
          "whenSame": "Matched weekend styles mean you'll naturally enjoy your time off the same way. If you're both planners, make lists together. If you're both spontaneous, let Saturday morning reveal itself. Either way, weekends restore rather than deplete.",

Touch-seekers need physical co-regulation; practical helpers need acts of service; space-needers require autonomy; distraction-seekers need mood shifts; explicitness-seekers want to be asked rather than assumed upon. Knowing your partner's de-stress wish list helps you support them effectively.",

Night owls with early birds, cuddlers with space-needers, light sleepers with heavy sleepers—these differences require negotiation. Since we spend roughly a third of our lives sleeping, getting this right matters more than many couples realize.",

          "whenDifferent": "The sacred-sleeper may resent disruptions; the flexible-sleeper may not understand the big deal. Respect each other's sleep needs: separate blankets, different wake times, even separate sleeping arrangements when needed. Quality sleep protects the relationship.",

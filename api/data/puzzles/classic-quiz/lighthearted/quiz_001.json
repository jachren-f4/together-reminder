          "rationale": "How we instinctively want to support a struggling partner reveals our own attachment patterns and love languages. Listeners offer emotional presence; cheerers try to shift the mood; space-givers respect autonomy; doers show love through action. None of these is the 'right' way—but mismatches can leave one partner feeling unsupported despite the other's best intentions. Understanding your default helps you stretch when your partner needs something different.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Your partner may need something different from what you instinctively offer. The listener may frustrate a partner who wants solutions; the fixer may frustrate a partner who just wants to be heard. The magic question is: 'What would help right now—venting, distraction, space, or practical help?'",
          "whenSame": "When you both instinctively offer the same kind of support, you'll naturally feel understood during hard times. Lean into this alignment, but remember that needs can shift depending on the situation.",

These micro-moments of connection—a text, a coffee, a touch, a question—accumulate into deep feelings of being loved and known. Understanding which small gestures matter most to your partner helps you make deposits in currency they actually value.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different gesture preferences map roughly to love languages: texts are words of affirmation, coffee is acts of service, hugs are physical touch, asking is quality time. Learn your partner's preferred currency and spend it often, even if it's not your native language.",
          "whenSame": "Shared small-gesture preferences mean your natural expressions of love will land. You'll both feel the connection from the same kinds of moments. Notice these and name them—'I love when you do that.'",

          "rationale": "How we experience separation reveals attachment patterns. Some people maintain connection through constant contact; others are comfortable with distance and reconnect later; some feel the absence acutely and count down to reunion. None of these is 'clingy' or 'distant'—they're different ways of holding the relationship when apart. Partners who misunderstand each other's separation style may feel smothered or abandoned.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "The constant-texter may feel their partner doesn't miss them; the space-enjoyer may feel overwhelmed by check-ins. Discuss expectations: 'I love you and also need quiet focus time' or 'A quick text helps me feel connected even when we're busy.'",
          "whenSame": "Matched separation styles mean you'll naturally sync on communication frequency when apart. You won't be wondering why they haven't texted or feeling pressured to respond constantly.",

          "rationale": "Feeling truly heard is one of the deepest human needs, and couples often have different cues that signal 'I'm listening.' For some, it's physical attention (eye contact, phone down); for others, it's engagement (questions); for others, it's memory (recalling details later); for others, it's presence without problem-solving. Knowing what makes your partner feel heard—and showing them those specific behaviors—builds profound connection.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "The eye-contact person may feel unheard if their partner asks great questions but keeps glancing at their phone; the question-asker may feel dismissed by silent presence. Name your cue: 'When you remember what I said last week, I feel so loved.'",

Laughter protects against the heaviness of life; deep conversations maintain emotional intimacy; rituals create stability and shared identity; surprises keep novelty alive. These aren't just preferences—they're the elements that make your relationship feel like itself. Protecting them is protecting the relationship.",
          "framework": "relationship_science",
          "whenDifferent": "Different 'never change' priorities reveal different relationship values. Both matter. The laugher needs you to stay playful; the deep-talker needs you to stay curious about their inner world. Honor both priorities.",

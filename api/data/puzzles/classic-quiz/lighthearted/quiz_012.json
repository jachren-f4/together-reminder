          "rationale": "Future visions reveal fundamental orientations toward stability versus change. Some people find security in continuity—deepening what already works. Others need growth and novelty to feel alive. Neither is more committed; they're different ways of imagining a thriving future. When partners' visions diverge significantly, it surfaces important conversations about compatibility and compromise.",
          "framework": "relationship_science",
          "whenDifferent": "The stability-seeker may feel their partner is never satisfied; the change-seeker may feel stagnant. This isn't a fight to win—it's a tension to balance. How can you create change while maintaining core stability? How can you deepen while also growing? The answer is usually 'both/and.'",
          "whenSame": "Shared future visions make long-term planning feel collaborative rather than conflictual. You're naturally building toward the same thing. Use this alignment to get specific: what exactly does your shared vision look like? Making it concrete brings it closer.",

          "rationale": "Bucket lists reveal what we consider meaningful and what we fear missing. They point to values: the traveler values experience, the learner values growth, the achiever values impact, the adventurer values intensity. Sharing these aspirations with a partner creates opportunities to support each other's dreams—or to discover shared dreams to pursue together.",
          "framework": "self_expansion_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different bucket list items mean different definitions of a life well-lived. This is an opportunity, not a problem. Can you help each other check off items? Can you find places where lists overlap? Your partner's dreams don't diminish yours—they expand your world.",
          "whenSame": "Shared bucket list priorities suggest shared values about what makes life meaningful. Make a combined list. Start planning. Couples who dream together often stay together because they have shared projects that keep them connected.",

          "rationale": "Emotional orientation toward the future reflects our relationship with uncertainty, our baseline optimism, and sometimes our experiences with plans going awry. Some people draw energy from anticipation; others find it anxiety-provoking. In relationships, these different orientations affect everything from vacation planning to life decisions. Neither is healthier—what matters is understanding each other.",
          "framework": "positive_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "The optimist may feel dragged down by their partner's caution; the present-focused partner may feel pressured to perform excitement they don't feel. Honor both: some conversations can be dreaming and excitement; others can be grounded in today. You don't need the same emotional relationship with the future.",
          "whenSame": "Matched emotional orientations toward the future mean your planning conversations will have similar energy. If you're both excited, dream big together. If you're both present-focused, create systems that force occasional future-thinking without it feeling burdensome.",

The home-builder values rootedness; the memory-maker values connection; the security-builder values safety; the adventurer values intensity. These aren't mutually exclusive, but primary priorities shape decisions about careers, location, time, and money. Misalignment here can feel like a fundamental incompatibility even when love is strong.",
          "framework": "relationship_science",
          "whenDifferent": "Different building priorities is a significant finding worth discussing deeply. The question isn't 'who's right' but 'how can we honor both?' Can you build a stable home AND have adventures? Can you create security AND prioritize experiences? Usually yes, but it requires explicit planning.",
          "whenSame": "Shared building priorities is a powerful alignment. You're working toward the same fundamental goal, which makes sacrifices feel shared rather than one-sided. Get specific about what this looks like and start building together.",

The relationship-motivated partner will sacrifice career for family; the achievement-motivated may do the opposite; the experience-seeker prioritizes enjoyment; the purpose-driven seeks impact. Understanding each other's motivations helps couples navigate trade-offs without feeling like their values are being dismissed.",
          "framework": "values_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "Different core motivations isn't a problem—it's information. The key is: do you each have space to pursue what matters to you? Does one partner's motivation consistently win? Can you reframe differences as balance—you bring drive, they bring connection; you bring meaning, they bring joy?",
          "whenSame": "Shared core motivations mean you'll naturally agree on big life decisions. You'll make similar trade-offs without negotiation. Build a life that centers on this shared motivation—you'll both feel fulfilled.",

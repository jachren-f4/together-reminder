          "rationale": "Money is one of the top sources of relationship conflict, and financial style differences often reflect deeper values around security, freedom, and control. Savers may have experienced financial instability; spenders may associate money with enjoyment and connection. Neither approach is inherently right—what matters is understanding the emotional meaning money carries for each partner and finding shared ground.",
          "framework": "financial_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "The saver may feel anxious watching their partner spend; the spender may feel controlled or judged. Money conversations often fail because they're about the numbers when they're really about security, freedom, or values. Start with: 'What did money mean in your family growing up?' Understanding the history changes the conversation.",
          "whenSame": "Aligned financial styles reduce one of the biggest relationship stressors. You'll naturally agree on saving versus spending without constant negotiation. Build on this alignment with shared financial goals that excite you both.",

          "rationale": "Spending priorities reveal what we value most—experiences, comfort, personal expression, security, or generosity. Research suggests experiences tend to bring more lasting happiness than possessions, but this varies by person. Understanding what your partner considers 'worth it' helps prevent conflicts where one person's 'waste of money' is another's joy.",

          "whenDifferent": "The experience-prioritizer may resent money 'wasted' on things; the security-prioritizer may feel experiences are frivolous. Create categories: some money for experiences, some for things, some for savings. Each partner gets a 'no questions asked' budget for their priorities.",
          "whenSame": "Shared spending priorities make financial decisions easier. You'll naturally agree on what's worth the money without feeling like you're sacrificing for your partner. Channel this alignment into intentional spending on what you both value.",

          "rationale": "Decision-making style—analytical versus intuitive—affects everything from car purchases to life choices. Researchers differentiate between 'maximizers' who exhaustively seek the best option and 'satisficers' who choose what's good enough. Neither is better, but couples often frustrate each other when one wants to 'just decide' and the other needs more research or time.",
          "framework": "decision_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "The researcher may feel rushed; the intuitive may feel paralyzed by analysis. Create rules: research for X days, then decide. Or: the person who cares more leads, the other supports. Big purchases shouldn't become power struggles.",
          "whenSame": "Matched decision styles make major purchases smoother. You'll naturally move through the process at the same pace. Be careful of shared blind spots—if you both avoid big decisions, things may stagnate; if you both research endlessly, you may never buy.",

          "rationale": "Security orientation often connects to early experiences with stability or scarcity. Those who prioritize security may have experienced financial precarity; those who focus on the present may have learned that worrying doesn't help or that life is unpredictable anyway. In relationships, these different orientations can clash: one partner builds emergency funds while the other wonders why they can't enjoy life now.",

          "whenDifferent": "The security-focused partner may feel their concerns are dismissed; the present-focused partner may feel life is passing by while waiting for 'enough.' Find the minimum security threshold that lets the anxious partner relax, then allocate the rest for present enjoyment. Both needs are valid.",
          "whenSame": "Shared security orientation means you won't fight about saving versus spending philosophically. If you're both security-focused, create specific goals so you know when 'enough' is reached. If you're both present-focused, build minimal automated safety nets so you can enjoy without risk.",

Some prefer full transparency and negotiation; others maintain autonomy through separate accounts; others use rotating decision-making. There's no single right answer—what matters is that both partners feel the system is fair and that their values are respected. Financial systems that feel controlling or dismissive erode trust.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different preferences for handling money disagreements IS the disagreement. The compromiser may feel separate money creates distance; the autonomy-seeker may feel merged money is controlling. Start here: what would 'fair' feel like to each of you?

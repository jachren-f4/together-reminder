What 'shouldn't' bother us often does—and dismissing these reactions doesn't make them go away. Partners who know each other's disproportionate triggers can avoid them out of care, not because they're 'right' but because it costs little to accommodate and means a lot to avoid.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different pet peeves mean different things will grate over time. Share your quirky triggers openly—not as demands but as information. 'This bothers me more than it rationally should' is honest and invites care without judgment.",

Understanding the need beneath the irritation helps partners see these moments with compassion rather than dismissal. When we know our partner needs information to feel in control, or hates being rushed because it triggers anxiety, we can respond to the need rather than judging the reaction.",

Knowing your non-negotiable eccentricities and communicating them clearly prevents partners from trying to 'fix' core personality traits. These aren't character flaws; they're features. The question is whether you can accommodate each other's features with grace.",

          "rationale": "Vacation preferences reveal what we need to feel restored. Some people recharge through stillness and relaxation; others through stimulation and discovery. Neither is 'wasting' a vacation—they're different nervous system needs. Couples who travel well together often learn to blend these styles or take turns choosing. The goal is returning home feeling better, whatever that takes for each of you.",
          "framework": "self_expansion_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "The relaxer may feel dragged around on an exhausting sightseeing marathon; the explorer may feel bored on a beach doing 'nothing.' Hybrid trips often work: mornings for adventure, afternoons for rest. Or alternate who picks each trip. Vacation shouldn't be a compromise that leaves both drained.",
          "whenSame": "Shared vacation styles make trip planning joyful rather than contentious. You'll naturally gravitate toward the same destinations and activities. Use this alignment to dream together about your next adventure.",

          "rationale": "Planning style reflects deeper orientations toward control, uncertainty, and trust. Planners often feel anxious without a roadmap; spontaneous types feel constrained by too much structure. Travel amplifies these differences because the stakes feel high—you've invested time and money, and you're away from home. Understanding your partner's planning needs prevents vacation fights about 'just going with the flow' versus 'sticking to the itinerary.'",
          "framework": "personality_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "The planner may feel their partner is reckless or doesn't care about the trip's success; the spontaneous partner may feel controlled or that all the fun is being engineered out. Try this: the planner books the essentials (flights, hotels), the spontaneous partner fills in the gaps. Both feel honored.",
          "whenSame": "Matched planning styles eliminate a major travel conflict. You'll naturally agree on how much to book ahead. If you're both planners, embrace detailed itineraries. If you're both spontaneous, build in flexibility and adventure.",

          "rationale": "Risk tolerance is partly temperamental, partly learned, and deeply personal. What feels thrilling to one person feels terrifying to another—and neither is wrong. In relationships, mismatched risk tolerances can lead to one partner feeling held back or the other feeling pushed beyond their limits. Healthy couples find ways to stretch each other gently while respecting hard boundaries.",
          "framework": "personality_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "The adventurer may feel bored or limited; the safety-seeker may feel pressured or anxious. Don't interpret caution as killing fun, or thrill-seeking as recklessness. Find activities at the edge of both comfort zones—challenging enough to excite, safe enough to enjoy. Sometimes do separate adventures.",
          "whenSame": "Shared risk tolerance means you'll naturally agree on activities. If you're both thrill-seekers, your adventures will push boundaries together. If you're both cautious, you'll enjoy exploring within your comfort zone without judgment.",

The foodie, the sightseer, the relaxer, and the authenticity-seeker all want something different from the same destination.

Explicit priority-sharing prevents the silent resentment of feeling like your needs don't matter.",

          "rationale": "Insecurity communication reveals attachment coping. Reassurance-seekers have anxious activation; withdrawers have avoidant activation; fine-actors mask vulnerability; open-expressers have secure communication. How you communicate when insecure determines whether your partner can actually help.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different insecurity communication creates misunderstanding. The withdrawer seems fine while suffering; the fine-actor may not receive needed support. Communicate directly about what you need.",

Need-saying difficulty suggests avoidant attachment; space-asking difficulty suggests anxious attachment; fear-expressing difficulty suggests catastrophizing; hurt-expressing difficulty suggests conflict avoidance. The hardest thing to say is often the most important.",

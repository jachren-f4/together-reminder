          "rationale": "How we handle too much closeness reveals attachment style. Rarely-overwhelmed suggests secure or anxious attachment; alone-time needers have healthy self-awareness; pull-backers may not recognize their pattern; space-communicators have learned healthy expression. Avoidant attachers often create distance unconsciously when closeness feels threatening.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different overwhelm responses can confuse partners. The rarely-overwhelmed may not understand their partner's need to pull back. Name the pattern.",
          "whenSame": "Shared overwhelm patterns help you understand each other—but two pullers-back may create excessive distance. Be intentional about reconnecting.",

          "rationale": "Post-conflict recovery needs reveal attachment soothing patterns. Verbal-reassurance seekers need explicit repair; physical-reconnectors need touch to restore safety; alone-time needers must self-regulate first; discussion-wanters need processing. Matching your repair style to your partner's recovery needs speeds reconnection.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different recovery needs extend post-conflict distance. The verbal-reassurance seeker feels abandoned by the alone-time needer. Ask: 'What would help us reconnect?'",

Regular affection soothes anxious attachment; team stress-handling builds secure partnership; commitment actions reassure those with abandonment fears; deep conversations create intimacy for emotionally-oriented people. Knowing what signals bond-strength for your partner helps you provide it.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different bond signals mean you may feel differently about the relationship's strength at the same moment. The affection-needer may doubt when physical touch decreases even if conversations are deep.",

          "rationale": "The need-independence balance reflects attachment style. Lean-toward-needing suggests anxious attachment; lean-toward-independence suggests avoidant attachment; good-balance suggests secure attachment; stress-shifting shows adaptability. The goal is flexible balance—able to depend and be independent based on context.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different balance points create the classic anxious-avoidant trap. The needing-more person may feel rejected by the independence-leaner; the independence-leaner may feel suffocated. Both are valid positions.",

          "rationale": "Independence needs reflect the balance between autonomy and connection. High-independence seekers may have avoidant attachment or healthy differentiation; moderate-seekers have flexible balance; low-independence seekers may have anxious attachment or genuine togetherness preference; variable-needers adapt to context.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different independence needs create the most common relationship struggle. The high-independence person may feel suffocated by the togetherness-seeker; the togetherness-seeker may feel abandoned. Neither is wrong—negotiate rather than judge.",

Fine-and-supportive suggests secure attachment; communication-dependent suggests need for reassurance; managed-insecurity shows aware anxiety; worried-response shows activated anxious attachment. How you respond to your partner's space-taking affects whether they feel safe taking it.",

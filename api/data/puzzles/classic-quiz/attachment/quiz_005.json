          "rationale": "Security sources reflect our deepest attachment needs. Communication consistency soothes separation anxiety; physical closeness provides bodily safety; commitment knowledge addresses abandonment fears; reliability builds trust through predictability. Knowing your partner's security source helps you provide exactly what calms their nervous system.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different security sources mean different things make you feel safe. Your partner's need for commitment confirmation may not resonate if you need physical closeness. Provide what they need, not what you would need.",
          "whenSame": "Shared security sources mean you naturally reassure each other. You understand what creates safety because it's the same for you.",

          "rationale": "Insecurity soothing needs vary by attachment and love language. Verbal reassurance calms through words; physical comfort calms through touch; quality time calms through presence; understanding calms through validation. Giving the wrong soothing can feel dismissive even when well-intentioned.",

Non-judgment creates psychological safety; gentle responses protect tender feelings; felt understanding validates experience; mutual vulnerability creates equality. Without these conditions, vulnerability feels too risky and intimacy remains shallow.",

Fear-sharing demonstrates emotional trust; physical affection demonstrates bodily trust; authenticity demonstrates self-trust; help-asking demonstrates dependency trust. Recognizing how your partner shows they feel safe helps you see their trust even if it differs from yours.",

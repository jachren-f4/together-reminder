      "metadata": {
        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "How we feel during separation is one of the clearest indicators of attachment style. Secure attachers feel trusting calm; anxious attachers feel worry; avoidant attachers enjoy independence; anxious-preoccupied attachers miss intensely. This reveals the internal working model of relationships formed in childhood.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different separation feelings often create the pursuer-distancer dynamic. The one who misses constantly may feel abandoned by the independence-enjoyer; the independence-enjoyer may feel smothered by constant missing. Understanding these as attachment patterns rather than personal rejection helps.",
          "whenSame": "Shared separation feelings suggest similar attachment orientations. If you both feel secure, separations are easy. If you both miss constantly, you may struggle with time apart together.",
          "journalPrompt": "How do you feel when your partner isn't around? Does your mind stay calm or does it wander to worries? What does your reaction tell you about your attachment?"

          "rationale": "Response to perceived distance reveals attachment activation. Space-givers show secure or avoidant patterns; reach-outers show anxious patterns; anxiety-and-reassurance seekers show anxious-preoccupied attachment; pull-backers show avoidant or fearful attachment. These responses often clash when partners differ.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different distance responses create relationship cycles. The reach-outer's attempts may feel like pursuit to the pull-backer, who retreats more, triggering more reaching out. Recognizing this cycle is the first step to breaking it.",
          "whenSame": "Shared distance responses can help (two space-givers respect boundaries) or create problems (two pull-backers may never reconnect). Awareness of your shared pattern matters.",

        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Core relationship fears shape attachment behavior. Abandonment fear drives pursuit and reassurance-seeking; independence-loss fear drives avoidance and boundary-setting; inadequacy fear drives perfectionism and people-pleasing; growing-apart fear drives connection maintenance. These fears usually trace to early experiences.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different core fears create different protective behaviors. The abandonment-fearer may cling while the independence-loser pulls away. Neither is wrong—both are protecting against their deepest wound.",
          "whenSame": "Shared core fears suggest similar attachment wounds. You'll deeply understand each other's anxiety because you share it. Be careful not to accidentally trigger your shared vulnerability.",

          "rationale": "Comfort with dependency is a hallmark of attachment security. Secure attachers feel comfortable depending on others; cautious types protect themselves; avoidant attachers prefer self-reliance; anxious attachers want to depend but fear it. The ability to healthily depend on your partner while maintaining autonomy is the goal of secure attachment.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different dependency comfort creates relationship tension. The comfortable-depender may feel rejected by the self-reliant partner's independence; the self-reliant may feel burdened by dependency. Both are coping strategies for the same underlying fear.",
          "whenSame": "Shared dependency comfort suggests similar attachment styles. Two comfortable-dependers will interweave easily; two self-reliant types may maintain more parallel lives.",

Consistent contact soothes anxious attachers; honesty builds trust for those with betrayal wounds; physical presence grounds touch-oriented people; shared plans reassure commitment-anxious people. Knowing your partner's security source helps you provide what they specifically need.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different security sources mean different things make you feel safe. Your partner's security source may not be yours—provide what they need, not what you would need.",

          "rationale": "Disconnection responses reveal attachment coping. Reach-outers have secure communication skills; waiters have passive hope or fear of rejection; attentive-increasers try to earn connection back; pull-backers protect against further hurt. How you respond to disconnection determines whether it heals or deepens.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different disconnection responses can widen the gap. The pull-backer's protection looks like rejection to the attentive-increaser; the waiter's patience looks like indifference to the reach-outer. Name your pattern.",

Deep-talkers need verbal processing; physical-intimacy seekers need bodily connection; quality-time needers need presence; verbal-love hearers need explicit expression.

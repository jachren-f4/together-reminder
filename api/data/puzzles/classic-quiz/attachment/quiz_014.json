          "rationale": "Overwhelm support needs reveal co-regulation patterns. Presence-needers co-regulate through proximity; space-needers self-regulate first; talk-throughers process externally; physical-comfort seekers regulate through touch. Providing the right support during overwhelm can dramatically shift emotional states.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",

Connection-calmers co-regulate through relationship; alone-processors self-regulate; movement-users regulate through body; talk-outers process externally.

          "rationale": "Conflict responses are deeply tied to attachment styles. Immediate pursuers have anxious attachment activation; space-needers have avoidant activation; fix-it-now types manage anxiety through action; withdrawers protect through distance. Your conflict response often triggers your partner's attachment system in return.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different conflict responses often create the pursue-withdraw cycle. The immediate pursuer escalates because the withdrawer won't engage; the withdrawer retreats because pursuit feels overwhelming. Name the pattern to break it.",
          "whenSame": "Shared conflict responses can be helpful or problematic. Two pursuers will engage intensely; two withdrawers may avoid necessary conversations. Know your shared pattern.",

          "rationale": "What we need during arguments reveals our attachment soothing system. Reassurance-seekers need attachment confirmation; space-needers need self-regulation time; validation-seekers need to feel heard; calm-presence seekers need co-regulation without escalation. Providing the wrong thing during conflict can escalate rather than resolve.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different argument needs create disconnects. The reassurance-seeker feels abandoned by the space-needer; the space-needer feels suffocated by pursuit. Ask: 'What do you need right now?' before assuming.",

          "rationale": "Processing time needs reflect nervous system regulation. Immediate-resolvers have anxiety that needs quick relief; brief-processors need minimal space; extended-processors need time for their system to settle; quick-movers recover fast. Respecting different processing times prevents re-triggering.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different processing times test relationships. The immediate-resolver may feel dismissed by the day-long processor; the extended-processor may feel pressured by immediate demands. Negotiate timing explicitly.",

          "rationale": "Conflict safety needs reveal core attachment requirements. Commitment-knowing addresses abandonment anxiety; calm-approach needs reflect sensitivity to dysregulation; feeling-heard addresses validation needs; won't-leave confidence addresses foundational security. Without these conditions, conflicts feel existentially threatening rather than solvable.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different safety needs mean you need different things to engage. Create your partner's safety conditions.",

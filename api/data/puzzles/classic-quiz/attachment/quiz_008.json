          "rationale": "Response to partner's busyness reveals attachment activation. Understanding-and-space shows secure attachment; patient-but-missing shows balanced longing; feeling-secondary shows activated anxiety; own-things shows secure independence or avoidance. How you handle your partner's unavailability affects relationship quality.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different busyness responses can create misunderstanding. The struggling-secondary person may feel abandoned while their partner is simply busy with life. Communicate: 'When I'm busy, it's not about us.'",

Closeness-seekers have anxious attachment activation; withdrawers have avoidant activation; independence-boosters manage through self-reliance; consistent types have secure attachment. Knowing your partner's stress-attachment style helps you respond appropriately rather than personalizing their behavior.",

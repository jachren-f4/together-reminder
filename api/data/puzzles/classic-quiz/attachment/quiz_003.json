      "choices": [
        "I directly ask for it",
        "I initiate physical contact",
        "I become more attentive to you",

      "metadata": {
        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "How we signal closeness needs reflects attachment communication patterns. Direct askers have secure communication; physical initiators use non-verbal bids; attention-givers hope for reciprocity; hinters learned indirect communication. Clear communication of closeness needs gets them met more reliably.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different closeness signaling means you may miss each other's bids. The direct asker may not notice the hinter's signals; the hinter may feel the direct asker doesn't need closeness. Learn to read your partner's language.",
          "whenSame": "Shared closeness signaling means you'll recognize each other's needs. You speak the same attachment language.",

      "metadata": {
        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Our attachment history shapes current patterns. Relationship hurts create protective walls; family patterns become templates; abandonment creates hypervigilance; enforced independence creates self-reliance. Understanding your partner's history with compassion helps you not take their patterns personally.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different attachment histories mean different wounds informing current behavior. Your partner's walls or clinginess may come from experiences you didn't share. Approach their history with curiosity.",

        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Comfort expressing needs reflects attachment security and childhood experiences. Direct askers learned their needs were valid; flexible types adapt to context; hinters learned indirect routes were safer; holders-back fear rejection or burden. Secure attachment involves trusting that expressing needs won't damage the relationship.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different needs-expression comfort requires different invitation levels. The direct asker may need to explicitly invite the holder-back to share; the holder-back needs patience and safety.",

Unanswered-message anxiety suggests abandonment fears; mood-sensitivity suggests hypervigilance for rejection; ex-mentions suggest comparison anxiety; time-apart triggers suggest separation anxiety. Knowing your triggers helps you manage them.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different triggers mean different things activate each of your attachment systems. What seems trivial to one may be threatening to the other. Treat each other's triggers with care.",
          "whenSame": "Shared triggers suggest similar attachment sensitivities. Be extra careful with your shared vulnerability—you can both be activated at once.",

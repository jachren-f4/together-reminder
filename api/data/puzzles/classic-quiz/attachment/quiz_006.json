          "rationale": "Reassurance types align with love languages and attachment needs. Hearing 'I love you' fills words-of-affirmation needs; physical touch provides bodily reassurance; being prioritized addresses abandonment anxiety; commitment actions build trust through proof. The type that reassures you most reflects your deepest attachment need.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different reassurance types mean your natural reassurance may not land. The verbal-reassurer may not realize their partner needs touch; the action-taker may not verbalize. Give reassurance in your partner's preferred form.",
          "whenSame": "Shared reassurance types mean your comfort will naturally register. You understand what reassures because it reassures you too.",

          "rationale": "Reassurance frequency reflects attachment style intensity. Frequent-needers have anxious attachment activation; daily-needers have moderate needs; stress-triggered seekers are context-dependent; rare-needers have secure attachment or avoidant suppression. There's no right amount—the goal is understanding and meeting each other's needs.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different reassurance frequencies can strain relationships. The frequent-needer may exhaust the rare-needer; the rare-needer may seem cold to the frequent-needer. Negotiate a rhythm that works for both.",

          "rationale": "Relationship fears reveal core attachment wounds. Stop-loving fear indicates abandonment anxiety; growing-apart fear indicates drift anxiety; not-enough fear indicates inadequacy; independence-loss fear indicates engulfment anxiety. Understanding your partner's core fear helps you avoid triggering it and provide specific reassurance.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different core fears drive different protective behaviors. The abandonment-fearer may cling; the independence-loser may distance. Neither is wrong—both are protecting against their deepest wound.",

          "rationale": "Worry-reassurance preferences reveal how our attachment system calms. Talking processes anxiety externally; physical comfort provides co-regulation; commitment reminders address abandonment directly; space allows self-regulation. Providing the wrong reassurance when your partner is worried can escalate rather than calm.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different worry-reassurance needs cause mismatch. The talk-through person may feel dismissed by the space-giver; the space-needer may feel smothered by pursuit. Ask: 'What would help right now?'",

Knowing what makes your partner feel certain about your love helps you provide that specific evidence.",

        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Core relationship needs reflect attachment foundations. Consistent-love seekers need reliability; freedom-seekers need autonomy; security-seekers need predictability; understanding-seekers need attunement. Your deepest need is often the one that was unmet in early attachment experiences.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different core needs require balance. The freedom-seeker may feel constrained by the security-seeker's needs; the security-seeker may feel anxious about the freedom-seeker's independence. Both needs are valid.",

          "rationale": "Past relationship impact reveals ongoing attachment work. Caution-protectors guard against repeat wounds; reassurance-seekers show activated anxiety; trust-workers are consciously healing; healed-secure shows integration. Acknowledging how the past affects the present enables conscious choice rather than reactive pattern.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",

Action-word match builds reliability trust; vulnerability-handling builds emotional trust; hard-time commitment builds abandonment-resistance; honest communication builds transparency trust. Knowing what builds your partner's trust helps you provide it intentionally.",

Naming your wound is the first step to healing it.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different attachment wounds trigger different protections. The abandonment-fearer may feel triggered by the control-fearer's distance; the control-fearer may feel triggered by the abandonment-fearer's closeness. Compassion for each other's wounds enables healing.",
          "whenSame": "Shared attachment wounds create deep understanding but may also reinforce patterns. Two abandonment-fearers may both avoid ever leaving, even when needed.",

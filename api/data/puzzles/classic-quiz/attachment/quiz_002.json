          "rationale": "Conflict patterns reveal attachment activation under stress. Quick resolvers can't tolerate disconnection; withdrawers protect themselves from overwhelm; immediate talkers process externally; alone-processors need self-regulation. These patterns often reflect childhood experiences with conflict in the family of origin.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different conflict patterns create the classic pursue-withdraw cycle. The immediate-talker chases the withdrawer, who retreats further, escalating anxiety. Naming your patterns without blame is the first step to changing them.",
          "whenSame": "Shared conflict patterns can help (two withdrawers give each other space) or hurt (two immediate-talkers may escalate). Know your shared tendencies.",

          "rationale": "Trust capacity is shaped by attachment history. Easy trusters often had secure early experiences; cautious trusters may have been hurt but recovered; slow-build trusters are protecting themselves; struggling trusters carry significant wounds. Trust is both earned in the present and influenced by the past.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different trust capacities require different patience levels. The easy-truster may not understand why their partner struggles; the struggling-truster may feel pressured. Meet your partner where they are with trust.",

          "rationale": "What soothes insecurity reveals our attachment system's needs. Verbal reassurance seekers need explicit comfort; quality-time seekers need presence; self-soothers need autonomy; physical comfort seekers need co-regulation through touch. Providing the wrong type of soothing when your partner is insecure can escalate rather than calm.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different insecurity soothing needs often clash. The verbal-reassurance seeker may feel abandoned by the self-soother's withdrawal; the self-soother may feel smothered by verbal pursuit. Ask: 'What would help right now?'",
          "whenSame": "Shared insecurity soothing means you'll instinctively provide what helps. You'll calm each other because you need the same thing.",

Space-givers trust the relationship can handle distance; fixers manage anxiety through action; worry-about-us responders have relationship-specific anxiety; check-in-not-push responders balance concern and respect. The anxious attacher's worst fear is often that their partner's bad mood is about them.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different stress responses can create misattunement. The worried-about-us person may feel dismissed by the space-giver; the space-giver may feel smothered by worry. Communicate explicitly: 'My stress isn't about us.'",

Understanding this helps clarify what the relationship provides.",

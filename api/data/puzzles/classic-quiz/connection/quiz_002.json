          "rationale": "Gottman's research on 'love maps' shows that couples who know each other's inner worlds have stronger relationships. But we often avoid certain topics—dreams feel vulnerable, fears feel heavy, relationship talks feel risky. Naming the conversation you want opens the door to having it. These deeper conversations are what build true intimacy over time.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different conversation desires reveal different emotional needs. The dreams-talker wants to be known in their aspirations; the fears-talker needs safety to be vulnerable; the relationship-talker wants meta-awareness. All are important—schedule time for each kind of deeper conversation.",

Gottman found that how couples tell their story—whether with fondness or cynicism—predicts relationship success.

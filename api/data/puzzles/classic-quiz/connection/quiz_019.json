Regular-needers require solitude for energy; moderate-needers appreciate balance; flexible people adapt; together-preferrers charge through connection; guilty-askers need but suppress the need. Healthy relationships honor both partners' autonomy needs without personalizing them.",
          "framework": "boundary_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different alone-time needs require negotiation, not compromise of needs. The regular-needer shouldn't feel guilty; the together-preferrer shouldn't feel rejected. Both needs are valid and can coexist.",

Partners should support each other's individual selfhood, not erase it.",

Understanding where your partner falls helps you know when to include them versus act independently.",

          "rationale": "Conflict needs vary dramatically and mismatched approaches escalate rather than resolve. Validation-seekers need to feel understood; space-seekers need time to regulate; calm-seekers need low intensity; reassurance-seekers need relational safety. Giving your partner what they need during conflict de-escalates faster than insisting on your own style.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different conflict needs are one of the most common relationship challenges. The validation-seeker feels abandoned by the space-seeker; the calm-seeker feels overwhelmed by intensity. Learn to meet your partner's need before pressing your own.",
          "whenSame": "Shared conflict needs make disagreements more manageable. You'll naturally give each other what helps during tense moments.",

          "rationale": "Conflict responses often reflect attachment patterns. Pursuers want immediate resolution through connection; withdrawers need self-regulation before engaging; fixers focus on problem-solving; defenders protect themselves from criticism. Understanding your and your partner's patterns helps you navigate conflict without triggering each other's defenses.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different conflict responses create the classic pursuer-withdrawer dynamic—one chases while the other retreats, escalating the cycle. Naming your patterns without judgment helps you interrupt them.",

          "rationale": "Repair—the reconnection after rupture—is essential for relationship health. Talk-through repairers need verbal processing; touch-repairers need physical reconnection; time-passers need natural fade; apology-seekers need accountability. Gottman's research shows that successful repair attempts, more than conflict avoidance, predict relationship success.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different repair styles can extend disconnection unnecessarily. The talk-through repairer may feel unresolved while the time-passer waits; the touch-repairer may feel rejected by the talk-first person. Learn to offer repair in your partner's language.",
          "whenSame": "Shared repair styles mean you'll naturally reconnect through the same process. Conflict resolution will feel complete to you both at the same time.",

Knowing what keeps your partner stuck helps you address the right thing during repair.",
          "framework": "emotion_focused_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different sticking points mean you get stuck for different reasons. Your partner may have moved on while you're still waiting for something you need. Name what's keeping you stuck.",

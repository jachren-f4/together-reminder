          "rationale": "Date preferences reveal relationship maintenance styles. Planned dates show effort and anticipation; spontaneous dates bring excitement; home dates value privacy and comfort; novel dates create self-expansion. Knowing what kind of dates feel meaningful to your partner helps you create experiences they'll treasure.",
          "framework": "self_expansion_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different date preferences mean you'll need to alternate or blend styles. The planned-date person may feel unvalued by spontaneity; the spontaneous-date person may feel constrained by structure. Take turns planning dates in each other's preferred style.",

Late-night-talkers bond through darkness and vulnerability; post-conflict connectors feel closest after repair; laughter-bonders connect through joy; quiet-moment lovers find intimacy in peace. Knowing when your partner feels most intimate helps you recognize and create those moments.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different intimacy peaks mean you experience closeness at different times. The post-conflict person may actually welcome disagreements as bonding opportunities; the quiet-moment person may find conflict depleting rather than connecting. Both experiences are valid.",

          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different showing styles mean you may miss each other's expressions of thought. The texter's messages may feel insufficient to the touch-lover; the helper's actions may not register for the texter. Learn to see 'I'm thinking of you' in your partner's language.",

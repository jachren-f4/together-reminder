      "metadata": {
        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "The way our partner shows love becomes a signature of their caring. Cooking meals is nurturing through provision; messages show they're thinking of us; planned surprises demonstrate effort and intention; unprompted help shows attentiveness to burden. Knowing which of your partner's expressions lands deepest helps them feel their love is received.",
          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different valued expressions mean you're each touched by different demonstrations of love. Tell your partner which of their loving actions means most—they may not know their cooking matters more to you than their gifts.",
          "whenSame": "Shared recognition of a meaningful love expression confirms it's central to your relationship. Do more of it. It's clearly working.",

          "rationale": "Feeling appreciated is essential to relationship satisfaction—Gottman found that expressing appreciation is one of the strongest predictors of lasting love. Some people feel most appreciated when noticed (attention), some when publicly acknowledged (validation), some through touch (physical affirmation), and some through explicit thanks (verbal gratitude). How appreciation lands varies significantly.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different appreciation languages mean your efforts may be missing the mark. The partner who needs to be noticed may not register verbal thanks as deeply; the public-acknowledgment person needs you to brag about them. Learn how appreciation lands for your partner.",
          "whenSame": "Shared appreciation languages mean you'll naturally make each other feel valued in the same way. This alignment makes gratitude flow naturally.",

          "rationale": "Affection creates connection, but what feels connecting varies. Physical touch (holding hands) creates bodily bonding; verbal affection (I love you) creates emotional certainty; surprises create delight and feeling thought of; attentive presence creates feeling valued. The form of affection that connects you most reveals your primary connection pathway.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different connecting affections mean you need different things to feel close. The touch-person may feel disconnected if verbal affection replaces cuddling; the attention-person feels unseen without focused presence. Give affection in your partner's form.",
          "whenSame": "Shared affection preferences make connection intuitive. You'll naturally create closeness through the same behaviors. Lean into this alignment.",

Knowing how your partner best receives encouragement helps you support their growth effectively.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different encouragement needs can lead to mismatched support. The verbal-praise person may feel the quiet-confidence partner is unsupportive; the practical-help person may feel words are empty. Ask: 'What kind of support would help right now?'",
          "whenSame": "Matched encouragement preferences mean you'll naturally support each other in ways that feel supportive. You both need the same thing when stretching and growing.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different team-feelings mean you experience partnership differently. The household-teamwork person may feel unpartnered if decisions aren't shared; the goal-supporter may not notice domestic collaboration. Both are valid forms of partnership.",

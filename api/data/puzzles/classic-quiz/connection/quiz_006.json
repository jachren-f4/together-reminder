          "rationale": "Gary Chapman's love languages framework identifies primary ways people receive love: words (verbal affirmation), service (helpful actions), time (undivided attention), and touch (physical affection). Most of us have one or two primary receiving languages—knowing your partner's helps you love them in ways they can actually feel.",
          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different receiving languages is the norm, not the exception. The touch-receiver may not feel loved by words alone; the time-receiver may feel unloved despite many acts of service. Learn to give love in your partner's language, not just your own.",
          "whenSame": "Shared receiving languages mean you'll naturally feel loved by the same things. Your love naturally translates because you speak the same dialect.",

Want-based givers prioritize fulfilling desires; thought-based givers want to demonstrate attention; sentimental givers seek emotional resonance; reaction-based givers need visible appreciation. Understanding what your partner values in giving helps you receive their gifts in ways that satisfy them.",
          "framework": "positive_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "Different giving values can create disconnection. The sentimental giver may feel hurt if their meaningful gift is casually received; the reaction-seeker needs visible delight. Receive gifts in ways that honor what your partner put into them.",

          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different favorite care expressions mean you're each touched by different daily gestures. The detail-rememberer needs to feel known; the check-in lover needs to feel thought of throughout the day. Do your partner's favorite care gesture often.",

Quiet presence soothes without demands; hugs provide physical co-regulation; validation normalizes feelings; solutions address problems. Partners often default to giving comfort how they'd want it, not how their partner needs it.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different comfort needs are extremely common and cause much relationship friction. The validation-seeker feels dismissed by solutions; the solution-seeker feels frustrated by 'just listening.' Ask: 'Do you want me to listen or help fix it?'",

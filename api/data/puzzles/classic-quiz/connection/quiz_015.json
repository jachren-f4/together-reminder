          "rationale": "How we respond to disconnection reveals attachment patterns. Reassurance-seekers actively pursue connection; waiters hope to be seen; protectors defend against hurt; activity-creators try indirect reconnection. Understanding these patterns helps partners recognize bids for connection even when they're indirect or hard to read.",

          "whenDifferent": "Different disconnection responses can perpetuate distance. The reassurance-seeker may feel their wait-and-see partner doesn't care; the protector may push away the pursuer. Name your patterns to each other.",
          "whenSame": "Shared disconnection responses mean you'll handle distance similarly—which can help (you understand each other) or harm (no one bridges the gap). Self-awareness is key.",

Silence-sensitives need regular contact; criticism-sensitives need acceptance; priority-sensitives need to feel chosen; conflict-sensitives need harmony. Knowing your partner's triggers helps you avoid accidentally activating their insecurity.",

Knowing what makes your partner feel secure helps you actively create safety.",

Providing the right soothing quickly calms attachment anxiety.",

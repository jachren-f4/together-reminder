          "rationale": "Gary Chapman's love languages framework revolutionized how we understand relationship satisfaction. Each person has a primary way of feeling loved—and often gives love the way they want to receive it, not the way their partner needs it. Identifying your partner's primary love language is the first step to making them feel truly loved rather than just going through the motions.",
          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different love languages is extremely common and often explains why one partner feels unloved despite the other's genuine efforts. The acts-of-service person may not register 'I love you' as meaningful; the words person may feel unappreciated by helpful actions alone. Learn to speak your partner's language, even when it doesn't come naturally.",
          "whenSame": "Shared primary love languages make love feel effortless—you'll naturally give what your partner needs most. This is a relationship advantage, but don't neglect the other languages entirely.",

          "rationale": "How we need support when distressed often reflects our attachment patterns. Some people co-regulate through physical touch; others need verbal processing; others require solitude to self-soothe; others need practical help. Partners who offer the wrong kind of support aren't unloving—they're offering what they would want. Learning your partner's support needs is crucial.",

          "whenDifferent": "The space-needer may feel smothered by a partner who wants to talk; the talker may feel abandoned by a partner who needs solitude. Ask directly: 'What do you need right now—space, talking, touch, or help?' Then honor the answer.",

Deep talkers bond through emotional disclosure; activity-sharers connect through doing; physically intimate partners bond through touch; quiet-time lovers connect through presence. Understanding your partner's primary connection pathway helps you create the closeness they can feel.",

Knowing what makes your partner feel secure helps you prioritize those elements, especially during uncertain times.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different security sources mean you may need to intentionally provide what your partner needs even if it's not what reassures you. The routine-person needs consistency; the communication-person needs honesty. Both are valid sources of security.",

The post-conflict person may actually welcome disagreements as reconnection opportunities; the everyday-moment person may feel the mundane is being neglected.

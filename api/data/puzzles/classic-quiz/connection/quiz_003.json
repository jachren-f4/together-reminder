        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Attachment theory shows that our need for reassurance reflects early bonding patterns. Some of us are soothed by words (hearing 'I love you'), others by touch (being held), others by processing (talking it through), and others by presence (simply being there). Knowing your partner's reassurance language allows you to calm their nervous system effectively during moments of anxiety.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different reassurance needs often lead to well-intentioned but misattuned support. The partner who needs words may feel uncared for when their tactile partner just holds them silently. Ask: 'What would help right now?' rather than assuming your comfort style works for them.",
          "whenSame": "Matched reassurance styles mean you'll naturally soothe each other in ways that land. When you both need presence, simply being there together creates safety. This alignment is a relationship asset.",

Understanding (feeling known), humor (playfulness), passion (intensity), and support (teamwork) all create unique bonds. Knowing what makes your relationship special to your partner reveals what they value most and need you to protect.",
          "framework": "narrative_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different valued qualities show you each treasure different aspects of the relationship. The understanding-valuer needs to be deeply known; the humor-valuer needs regular playfulness. Both perspectives reveal genuine relationship strengths.",

Support during hardship, sacrifice for the relationship, reliability when needed, and acceptance of our shadow sides all communicate deep love in different ways. Knowing which moment mattered most to your partner reveals what form of love lands deepest for them.",
          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different meaningful moments reveal different emotional currencies. Your partner may have felt most loved in a moment you barely remember—naming it validates their experience and teaches you what matters to them.",

Their care is real, even if it looks different from what you'd expect.",
          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different expression styles are extremely common. The acts-of-service expresser shows love by doing; the words expresser verbalizes constantly. Learn to see your partner's expressions as love, even when they don't match your receiving style.",

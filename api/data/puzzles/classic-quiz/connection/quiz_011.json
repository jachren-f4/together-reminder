          "rationale": "Quality time means different things to different people. Activity-lovers connect through doing; conversationalists bond through talking; novelty-seekers need new experiences; relaxers need low-pressure time. A relationship needs enough of each partner's preferred quality time to feel connected.",
          "framework": "love_languages",
          "whenDifferent": "Different quality time preferences mean you feel connected at different moments. The activity-lover may feel bored just sitting; the relaxer may feel exhausted by constant activity. Balance both styles of togetherness.",
          "whenSame": "Shared quality time preferences mean you'll naturally create connection through the same activities. You experience togetherness the same way.",

          "rationale": "Physical affection needs vary widely and aren't indicators of love depth. High-touch people feel connected through constant contact; moderate-touch people need some physical connection; context-dependent touchers separate daily and intimate; light-but-consistent touchers prefer ongoing small touches. Touch mismatches cause significant relationship distress.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different touch needs create one of the most challenging relationship mismatches. The high-touch person may feel rejected by the lower-touch partner; the lower-touch person may feel smothered. Negotiate rather than personalize touch differences.",

          "rationale": "Togetherness needs reflect introversion/extroversion and attachment style. High-togetherness people recharge through connection; balanced people need both; space-needers require solitude to function. Partners with different togetherness needs must negotiate rather than assume their need is 'right.'",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different togetherness needs are extremely common and require explicit negotiation. The high-togetherness partner may feel rejected by the space-needer's need for solitude; the space-needer may feel suffocated by constant togetherness. Neither is wrong—both needs are valid.",

Knowing how your partner maintains intimacy helps you contribute to ongoing closeness.",

Understanding what makes intimacy connecting for your partner deepens the experience.",

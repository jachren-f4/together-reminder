          "rationale": "Communication medium matters more than we realize. Face-to-face allows for full presence; walking reduces intensity; in-the-moment sharing is spontaneous and raw; thinking first enables thoughtful delivery. Partners who prefer different channels may miss or misinterpret important messages.",
          "framework": "communication_science",
          "whenDifferent": "Different communication channels can cause friction. The face-to-face person may feel dismissed by indirect communication; the think-first person may feel overwhelmed by immediate demands. Adapt to your partner's receiving channel for important conversations.",
          "whenSame": "Shared communication channels mean important conversations will flow naturally. You'll both be comfortable with the same medium.",

        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "Upset communication patterns often reflect attachment styles formed early in life. Immediate talkers process externally and need verbal connection; space-needers must self-regulate first; withdrawers protect themselves through distance; assertive communicators become more direct under stress. These patterns often clash when partners differ.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different upset styles cause significant conflict escalation. The immediate talker may chase the withdrawer; the space-needer feels smothered by the pursuer. Learn each other's patterns: 'When I'm upset, I need X before we can talk productively.'",
          "whenSame": "Matched upset styles make conflict more manageable. You'll naturally give each other what's needed during tense moments.",

        "therapeutic": {
          "rationale": "How we prefer our partner to share their upset differs from our own upset style. Some prefer directness—just tell me; others need calm—not emotional intensity; others appreciate processing time; others want heads-up on space-taking. Knowing your partner's receiving preferences helps you share your upset in ways they can hear.",
          "framework": "communication_science",
          "whenDifferent": "Different receiving preferences for upset partners mean your natural sharing style may not land well. The direct-preferrer feels confused by hints; the calm-preferrer feels overwhelmed by intensity. Adjust how you share upset based on how your partner receives it.",
          "whenSame": "Shared receiving preferences mean your upset communication will be received as intended. You both want the same approach when the other is distressed.",

          "rationale": "Attention-getting preferences reflect boundaries and processing styles. Touch-preferrers are physically responsive; name-callers need full focus before continuing; break-waiters need completion; start-talkers can split attention. Partners who interrupt in unwanted ways create small daily friction that accumulates.",
          "framework": "boundary_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different attention-getting preferences can cause minor but repeated irritation. The touch-preferrer may startle the name-caller; the break-waiter may feel ignored by the start-talker. Small accommodations in how you get attention prevent daily friction.",
          "whenSame": "Shared attention-getting preferences mean interruptions will feel natural rather than jarring. You'll both appreciate the same approach.",

          "rationale": "Request styles affect compliance and resentment. Direct-with-reasons satisfies those who need context; gentle suggestion feels less demanding; appreciation-first acknowledges prior contribution; advance notice respects scheduling. Asking in the wrong way can make even willing partners resistant.",
          "framework": "positive_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "Different request preferences can create unnecessary friction. The direct-with-reasons person may feel controlled by advance-notice requests; the appreciation-first person may feel taken for granted by direct requests. Match your asking style to your partner's preference.",

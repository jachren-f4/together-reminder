          "rationale": "Core emotional needs drive relationship satisfaction. Consistent love needs daily reassurance; being heard needs active listening; goal support needs championing; being desired needs attraction shown. When our primary need goes unmet, we feel the relationship is failing even if other areas are strong.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different core needs require different relationship investments. The consistency-seeker needs daily evidence; the heard-seeker needs deep listening; the desired-seeker needs attraction expressed. Know and prioritize your partner's primary need.",

          "rationale": "Emotional regulation strategies differ significantly between people. Some co-regulate through words; others through physical contact; others need solitude to self-regulate; others process by talking. Understanding how your partner calms down helps you support their regulation rather than interfere with it.",
          "framework": "emotion_focused_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different calming needs often clash. The touch-calmer may feel rejected by the space-needer; the talker may feel abandoned by the silence-needer. State what you need: 'I need 10 minutes alone, then let's talk.'",
          "whenSame": "Matched calming strategies mean you can help each other regulate in the same way. You instinctively provide what soothes.",

          "framework": "gottman",
          "whenDifferent": "Different prioritization needs mean different things make you feel chosen. The choice-seeker needs visible selection; the inclusion-seeker needs collaborative decisions. Show priority in your partner's language.",

          "rationale": "How we share feelings reflects our processing style. Some need dedicated conversation space; others integrate emotionally as they go; others communicate through behavior; others need solitary processing first. Partners with different sharing styles may misinterpret each other—the gradual sharer may seem distant to the deep-conversation seeker.",
          "framework": "emotion_focused_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different sharing styles create miscommunication. The planned-conversation person may feel their action-sharing partner never opens up; the process-first partner may feel pressured by immediate demands. Adapt to each other's pace and style.",
          "whenSame": "Matched sharing styles mean emotional conversations flow naturally. You're on the same wavelength about when and how to process together.",

Some recharge through togetherness; others through physical contact; others through verbal support; others need solitude before connection. Knowing how your partner recharges helps you give them what they need after depleting days.",
          "framework": "positive_psychology",
          "whenDifferent": "Different recharging needs may conflict at day's end. The together-recharger may feel rejected by the alone-time-first partner; the verbal-support person may need to process before other activities. Communicate what you need after hard days.",
          "whenSame": "Matched recharging styles mean evenings flow naturally. You'll both want to recharge the same way, making end-of-day transitions smooth.",

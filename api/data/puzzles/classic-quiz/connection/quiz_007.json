          "rationale": "Stress responses vary significantly based on attachment style and temperament. Some people need solitude to self-regulate before connecting; others need presence without demands; others need verbal processing; others need practical assistance. Offering the wrong kind of support when your partner is stressed can feel like abandonment or intrusion.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different stress needs require conscious adaptation. The space-needer may feel smothered by the presence-giver; the venter may feel dismissed by the problem-solver. State explicitly what you need when stressed: 'I need to be alone for 20 minutes, then I'll want to talk.'",
          "whenSame": "Matched stress responses mean you'll naturally support each other in ways that help. You understand what's needed because you need the same thing.",

          "rationale": "Emotional connection has multiple pathways: vulnerability creates depth; physical intimacy creates bonding; shared mundane moments create companionship; comfortable silence creates peace. Understanding your partner's primary connection pathway helps you create the closeness they can feel.",
          "framework": "attachment_theory",
          "whenDifferent": "Different connection pathways mean you experience closeness at different moments. The vulnerability-connector may feel distant in a physically intimate but emotionally surface relationship; the silence-connector may feel pressured by constant deep talks. Balance both styles.",

Some people need verbal reassurance to calm anxiety; others need practical relief from burden; others need witnessing without fixing; others need solitude and grace. How your partner responds when you're at your lowest profoundly shapes relationship security.",
          "framework": "emotion_focused_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different crisis needs can create hurt during already hard times. The reassurance-seeker may feel abandoned by a task-focused partner; the space-needer may feel smothered by closeness. Communicate clearly: 'Today I really need...'",

          "framework": "emotion_focused_therapy",
          "whenDifferent": "Different understanding triggers mean different things make you feel seen. The validation-seeker needs emotional acknowledgment; the depth-seeker needs to be seen past their defenses. Know what makes your partner feel understood.",
          "whenSame": "Shared understanding triggers mean you'll make each other feel known in the same way. You understand what it means to be seen because you need the same thing.",

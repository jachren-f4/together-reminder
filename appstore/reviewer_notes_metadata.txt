Hi again,

I wanted to follow up regarding Guideline 2.3.2 (Accurate Metadata), which I didn't address in my previous message.

We have updated the App Store description to clearly indicate that Us 2.0 requires a subscription after the free trial. The changes include:

- Added "Start with a 7-day free trial, then continue with Us 2.0 Premium to unlock unlimited activities and rewards" near the top
- Added a dedicated SUBSCRIPTION INFO section explaining auto-renewal and how to manage the subscription

Please let me know if any further changes are needed.

Thank you!

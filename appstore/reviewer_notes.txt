HEALTHKIT USAGE - STEPS FEATURE

The Steps feature uses HealthKit to help couples stay active together by tracking and comparing daily step counts.

How to access:
1. Log in with the demo account above
2. On the home screen, scroll to the Games carousel (below the Quizzes carousel)
3. Scroll right to find the Steps card (3rd position)
4. Tap to open

How it works:
- Grant HealthKit permission when prompted
- Both partners see each other's daily step progress
- Couples earn Love Points (15-30 LP) when reaching step goals together

Why HealthKit is required:
Steps is a core engagement feature that turns daily fitness into a shared couple activity with rewards. It reads step data from HealthKit to display progress, compare partner activity, and award Love Points for staying active together.

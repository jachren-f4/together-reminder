# Content Strategy Guide

This directory contains content strategy documentation for all TogetherRemind activities. These docs define **what value each activity delivers** and **how to create effective content**.

For technical implementation details (file paths, manifests, asset formats), see [BRANCH_MANIFEST_GUIDE.md](../BRANCH_MANIFEST_GUIDE.md).

## Content Philosophy

Every piece of content in TogetherRemind should:

1. **Strengthen the relationship** - Not just entertain, but create understanding
2. **Spark conversation** - The activity is a starting point, not the endpoint
3. **Reveal something useful** - Matches and mismatches should be illuminating
4. **Feel appropriate to the branch** - Tone and depth should match user expectations

## Activity Types

## Branch System

Most activities have multiple **branches** that cycle as couples progress. Branches allow content to evolve in tone and depth.

### Common Branch Patterns

| Pattern | Branches | Philosophy |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Depth progression | lighthearted → meaningful → intimate | Start easy, go deeper over time |
| Tone variation | playful → reflective → spicy | Different moods for different days |
| Theme rotation | everyday → passionate → naughty | Variety in subject matter |

### Branch Documentation

Each activity document includes:
- Branch descriptions and target tone
- Question/content guidelines per branch
- Examples of good vs. poor content

---

## Creating New Content

When adding or updating content:

1. **Read the activity document** - Understand the value proposition
2. **Match the branch tone** - Lighthearted ≠ Meaningful ≠ Intimate
3. **Test with the mechanic** - Does a match/mismatch reveal something useful?
4. **Consider conversation potential** - What might couples discuss after?

---
